# Task: Install Dependencies

This task involves installing the necessary NPM packages for the project.

## Steps

1.  Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install @playwright/test rimraf typescript @types/node
    ```

    This command will install the following packages:

    *   `@playwright/test`: For browser automation.
    *   `rimraf`: For cross-platform directory removal.
    *   `typescript`: For TypeScript compilation.
    *   `@types/node`: For Node.js type definitions.

## Expected Outcome

After running the command, the `package.json` file should be updated to include the installed packages in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section. The `node_modules` directory should also be populated with the installed packages.
